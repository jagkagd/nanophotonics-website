    p.
        Low-dimensional nanostructures are fascinating platforms for manipulating electrons, photons, plasmons, phonons, and atoms for both scientific research and technological applications.
        For low-dimensional photonics, the one-dimensional micro/nanofiber or nanowire is of particular great importance owing to its ability to route tightly confined light fields in single-mode with lowest space and material requirements, minimized optical path, and high mechanical flexibilities.
    p Since 2003, our group has been working on nanophotonics combining photonics and nanotechnology, as shown below
