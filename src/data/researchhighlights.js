The SH spatial image can be readily converted to the temporal profile of the pulses, and only an overall pulse energy of 8 μJ is needed to acquire a clear image of 200 fs pulses.

By tuning the carrier density via electrical or optical means that modifies their physical properties (e.g., Fermi level or nonlinear absorption), optical response of the 2D materials can be instantly changed, making them versatile nanostructures for optical modulation. Here, up-to-date 2D materialbased optical modulation in three categories is reviewed: free-space, fiberbased, and on-chip configurations. By analysing cons and pros of different modulation approaches from material and mechanism aspects, the challenges faced by using these materials for device applications are presented. In addition, thermal effects (e.g., laser induced damage) in 2D materials, which are critical to practical applications, are also discussed. Finally, the outlook for future opportunities of these 2D materials for optical modulation is given.",

Here we report hybrid integration of free-standing nanowires into silicon photonics with high flexibility by coupling free-standing nanowires onto target silicon waveguides that are simultaneously used for precise positioning. Coupling efficiency between a free-standing nanowire and a silicon waveguide is up to ~97% in the telecommunication band. A hybrid nonlinear-free-standing nanowires–silicon waveguides Mach–Zehnder interferometer and a racetrack resonator for significantly enhanced optical modulation are experimentally demonstrated, as well as hybrid active-free-standing nanowires–silicon waveguides circuits for light generation.

Here, we demonstrate ChG microfiber knot resonators (MKRs) operating in the mid-IR for the first time, and investigate the wavelength tunability, the structure of a PMMA-embedded on-chip ChG MKR. ChG microfibers with typical diameters around 3 μm are taper-drawn from As2S3 glass fibers and assembled into MKRs in liquid without surface damage. The measured Q factor of a typical 824 μm diameter ChG MKR is about 2.84 × 104 at the wavelength of 4469.14 nm. The free spectral range (FSR) of the MKR can be tuned from 2.0 nm (28.4 GHz) to 9.6 nm (135.9 GHz) by tightening the knot structure in liquid. Benefitting from the high thermal expansion coefficient of As2S3 glass, the MKR exhibits a thermal tuning rate of 110 pm • °C-1 at the resonance peak. When embedded in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film, a 551 μm diameter MKR retains a Q factor of 1.1 × 104.
